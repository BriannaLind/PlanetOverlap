"""
client.py - Entry point for running Planet Overlap analysis.

This script:
1. Reads AOI GeoJSON files.
2. Applies filters (geometry, date, cloud cover, sun angle).
3. Handles spatial and temporal tiling automatically.
4. Calls pagination module to fetch imagery.
5. Calls analysis module to compute overlaps and sun angles.
6. Stores output to configurable directory.

Supports multiple AOIs and multiple date ranges.
